        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I'm a rising junior from Long Island, New York. I'm majoring in Computer Science
            and minoring in Digital Media Studies. Before UR, I spent the first semester of
            my college career at RPI studying Mechanical Engineering. Aside from computing,
            I love cooking, volunteering, hiking/the outdoors, and music!</p>
