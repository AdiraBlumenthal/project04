        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I'm a rising junior from Long Island, New York. I'm majoring in Computer Science
            and minoring in Digital Media Studies. Before UR, I spent the first semester of
            my college career at RPI studying Mechanical Engineering. Aside from computing,
            I love cooking, volunteering, hiking/the outdoors, and music!</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>

            <p>I'm interested in computer vision, security, and machine learning - and how we
                can use these technologies to help people in their everyday life and their jobs.</p>

        <p class="desc">My team and I are working on providing clean drinking water to a

            contaminated water source. I have several duties like coordinating meetings,

            for the national organization.</p>
