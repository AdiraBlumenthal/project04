                <h3>Master's</h3>

                <p>Jason is pursuing a Master's of Education from the Warner School via the Guaranteed Rochester Accelerated Degree in Education (GRADE) program. He is intending to utilize the combined degree option to also complete an Advanced Certification in Digitally-Rich Teaching in K-12 Schools. Outside of formal education, Jason has worked in afterschool and summer programs, as well as tutoring students in the Java programming language.</p>

            <h3>Minor: Linguistics</h3>
            <p>Jason has completed a cluster in Language Structure via the linguistics department. This cluster is defined as one that "focuses on the semantics and pragmatics of natural language and how linguistic forms and their usages give rise to meanings" (<a href="https://secure1.rochester.edu/registrar/CSE/clusterView.php?clusterNumber=S1LIN005" target="_blank">source</a>). In the fall, Jason plans to finish all remaining coursework to turn this cluster into a minor in linguistics.</p>

            <h3>Cluster: Theatre</h3>
            <p>Jason has also completed a cluster in Theatre Production and Performance via the theater department (housed in the English department), and then some. He originally intended on completing a certificate in stage management, but realized the extracurricular requirements were too steep to complete alongside a master's degree.</p>

            <h3>Electives</h3>
            <p>Jason occasionally takes some classes that don't count toward his major, grad program, minor, or cluster. These courses are just for fun...and to meet the minimum required 128 credit hours, of course!</p>
