        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Rochester, class of 2021.
            I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
            I'm also minoring in International Relations. When I'm not busy building
            complex worlds,I like to write and draw in my spare time.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> My main goal is to pursue a career in the "creative side" of computer science,
                more specifically Front-End Web Development and Video Game Development.</p>
        </header>

        <h2>Beginning</h2>
        <p> Ever since I was young, I've had a natural affinity for writing, creative
            writing specifically. So I spent years creating complex worlds and figuring out how
            they would operate if it was the setting for a video game. It wasn't until I
            was introduced to the book series "The 39 Clues" that I realized how websites
            could be used as a medium for creativity. The series had a website dedicated
            to expanding the world presented inside the book in ways I had never seen before,
            with games, puzzles and an overall interactive website that engaged users.
            It was then that I started writing designs for websites for worlds I created, thus
            marking my start into being interested in visual media.
        </p>

        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p> Up until high school, I had mostly focused on writing and dabbled
            every now and then in attempting to learn Java in my spare time
            with my friends. However, being that I was attending a writing school, I was not only
            able to technically enhance my writing skills, but I was also introduced
            to my first Computer Science class. That class allowed me to learn
            programming at a much faster rate and would lead me into the world of
            robotics briefly as the Computer Science teacher recruited me for the
            robotics team in my senior year. On the robotics team, not only was I on the
            programming team, but I was also on the PR Team where I had my first experience
            with creating a website.

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p> Since entering the U of R, I've taken a host of Computer Science classes
                    including Video Game Development and a Web Development course, both of
                    which has expanded my skillset and helped me to understand what I want to pursue
                    as a career. In the summer, I was hired as part of a online retail start up.
                    Mostly doing administrative duties, I ended up hiring Web Developers who
                    taught me a lot about the industry and gave me a chance to see the relationship
                    between developer and client from two different viewpoints at the same time.
