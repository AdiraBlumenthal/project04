        <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Rochester, class of 2021.
            I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
            My main goal is to pursue a career in the "creative side" of computer science, 
            more specifically Front-End Web Development and Video Game Development.
