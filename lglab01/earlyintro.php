        <p> Ever since I was young, I've had a natural affinity for writing, creative
            writing specifically. So I spent years creating complex worlds and how
            they would operate if it was the setting for a video game. It wasn't until I 
            was introduced to the book series "The 39 Clues" that I realized how websites
            could be used as a medium for creativity. The series had a website dedicated
            to expanding the world presented inside the book in ways I had never seen before,
            with games, puzzles and an overall interactive website that engaged users.
            It was then that I started writing designs for websites for worlds I created, thus
            marking my start into being interested in visual media.
