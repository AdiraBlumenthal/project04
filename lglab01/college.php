        <p> Since entering the U of R, I've taken a host of Computer Science classes
            including Video Game Development and a Web Development course both of
            which has expanded my skillset and helped me understand what I want to pursue 
            as a career. In the summer, I was hired as part of online retail start up.
            Mostly doing administrative duties, I ended up hiring Web Developers who 
            taught me a lot about the industry and gave me a chance to see the relationship
            between developer and client from two different viewpoints at the same time.
