        <p> Up until high school, I had mostly focused on writing and dabbled
            every now and then in attempting to learn Java in my spare time
            with my friends. However, attending a writing school, I was not only
            able to technically enhance my writing skills, but I was also introduced
            to my first Computer Science class. That class allowed me to learn 
            programming at a much faster rate and would lead me into the world of
            robotics briefly as the Computer Science teacher recruited me for the 
            robotics team in my senior year. On the robotics team, not only was I on the
            programming team, but I was also on the PR Team where I had my first experience
            with creating a website.
