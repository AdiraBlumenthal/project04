- Adira Blumenthal
- Joo Eon Park
- Elise Frelinger

## Choices
Technician: 
- set up the database on the class server
- pulled data from database to be displayed on studentlist.php
- Worked with the IA to get the HTML form integrated with the database system

IA:
- A student can access the database with editing capabilities (through "Your Account") while a non-student visitor can access the database without editing capabilities (through "View All Students")
- "Your Account" button links to portal.php and allows the student to add, edit, or delete profiles. Canceling the database page or HTML form leads back to this page
- The "Add New Profile" button links directly to the HTML form for convenience
- The choreography is clear and structured, but forgiving of user misclicks 
	- The "Edit Profile" and "Delete Profile" buttons give the student clear options, but the choice to delete remains easily accessible under the umbrella of editing (and vice versa)
	- After hitting "Edit Profile" or "Delete Profile," the option to create a profile is not prominent, but still accessible
- After creating a profile, a user can inspect their profile (and make sure they are happy), or visit the homepage to find out more about the class
