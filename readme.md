## Classes and Relationships
We focused our website on a few things that we all had in common. We are all students at the University of Rochester majoring in Computer Science. We focus a lot of our website on our educational interests, coding skills, work experience, and courses we have taken. Towards the bottom of our pages we shift to talking about our extracurriculars, mentioning the clubs we are a part of and displaying portfolios of some of our work.

## Choreography
On each subpage, we start with an overview of who that group member is, mentioning background information such as their hometown, major, and class year. Then continue with general information about each person's academic interests. Then we go into more specifics about our educational background, our coding skills, and work experiences. We started with a broad overview of who we are and what we are interested in and then we state our qualifications with our educational background, skills, and work experiences. Then we show our extracurricular interests to show our well-roundedness when we talk about our club involvement and display our portfolios.
