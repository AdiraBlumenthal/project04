## Choices
- Because each one of the students on our page are majoring in computer science, we chose the following design:
	- Blue, white, and black technical background for a CSC feel
	- Orange, blue, light blue and hot pink accents for a neon feel
	- Stars on the read more images to relate to advancing technologies and art
	- Fonts chosen are computer science like
	- White text to be read on the darker background
	- Light gray selection property to contrast with the dark background
	- Gray accents in places to not contrast with the bright colors
	- Logo was picked due to its bright colors contrasting with the dark background
